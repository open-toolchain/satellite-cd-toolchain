template.name: "111:Deploy your application to multiple clusters"
template.description: "112:With this toolchain, you can deploy to multiple Red Hat OpenShift clusters hosted on IBM Cloud Satellite. The template makes use of a [pull based deployment](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-deployment-model#deployment-model-pull) mechanism provided by [IBM Cloud Satellite config](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-cluster-config) for application deployment. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Golang \"Hello World\" app for demonstration, but you can also bring your own application and deploy it instead. \n\nThis toolchain is built using [Tekton](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/tekton?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=tekton[%20triggers]) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg) and uses tools that are part of the [IBM Continuous Delivery service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-continuous-delivery-tekton-pipelines-tools-and-resources) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg). If the instance of the service is not present in the selected resource group, when you click Start, it will be automatically added when a free lite plan is selected. \n\n\n\n After setup, **you can use Triggers, to deploy multiple applications in the single pipeline**. Learn more about [using the triggers here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tekton-pipelines) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg) \n\n\n\n **To progress to the next mandatory step directly, click 'Create toolchain' else click 'Continue' to move to the next step.**\n\n This overview shows the framework of the toolchain that you will create. \n\n"
template.gettingStarted: "113: **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Satellite source repository to trigger a new deployment to the IBM Cloud Satellite cluster group. \n\n Please checkout [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-only-satellite) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg) for more details."
