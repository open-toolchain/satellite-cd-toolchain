template.name: "Deploy your application to multiple clusters"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can deploy to multiple RedHat OpenShift clusters hosted on IBM Satellite.  The template makes use of [pull based deployment](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-deployment-model#deployment-model-pull) mechanism provided by [Satellite config](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-cluster-config) for  application deployment. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js booking application for demonstration, but you can also bring your own application and deploy it instead. This toolchain is built using [Tekton](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/tekton?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=tekton%20triggers) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg) and uses tools that are part of the [IBM Continous Delivery service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-continuous-delivery-tekton-pipelines-tools-and-resources) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg). If the instance of the service is not present in the selected resource group, when you click Start, It will be automatically added with free lite plan selected. \n\n\n\n After setup, **you can use Triggers, to deploy multiple applications in the single pipeline**. learn more about [using the triggers here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tekton-pipelines) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg)"
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the manifest repo to trigger a new deployment of application to the Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes) for this toolchain."
wizard.welcome.prereq: "**Prerequisite required** \n\n \n\n 1. **Satellite Location:** If you dont have satellite location, [create one here.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg). \n\n 2. **Satellite Cluster group:**  If you do not have existing IBM Satellite cluster group on IBM Cloud, you can [create one here.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-setup-clusters-satconfig#setup-clusters-satconfig-groups) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg) Then add your required clusters to cluster group.  \n\n 3. **Image Pull Secrets:** Ensure you have configured the [Image pull secrets](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html) ![](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/launch-glyph.svg) required for deploying application images in your cluster namespace."
